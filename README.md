# Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS)

![repo](./static/images/igs-background.png)

Welcome to **Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS)!** The IGS is an open-source tool to visualize movement, conversation, and video data over space and time. It provides fluid ways to create interactive visualizations and animations to explore how spatial and multimodal interactions evolve over time. The IGS runs entirely in your browser. No transcripts or videos are uploaded, stored, or transmittedâ€”your data stays on your device at all times.

## Get Started

- **Visit**: https://www.interactiongeography.org

## IGS Features

- **Browser-based**: Everything in your browser.
- **Visualizations**: Create dynamic 2D/3D space-time visualizations at different scales.
- **Mix multi-modal data sources**: Explore movement, conversation, and video data independently or simultaneously in the same visualization.
- **Interactions and animations**: Create dynamic animations to communicate your data
- **Use in qualitative and quantitative projects**: Supports projects spanning micro-ethnographic analysis of gesture; mid-scale analyses of movement and conversation in settings like classrooms and museums; and larger scale analysis of urban mobility.
- **Future features**: We are rapidly developing and expanding IGS features, and collaborators in this effort are welcome.

## Frameworks and Libraries

- **Svelte**: A lightweight and powerful framework for building fast, interactive web applications.
- **Papa Parse**: Used for fast CSV data parsing in JavaScript.
- **p5.js**: For generating the custom visualizations of movement and conversation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For visually appealing user interface.
