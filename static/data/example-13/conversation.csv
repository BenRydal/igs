1446062203,Ashley,maybe I'll try the youtube now

1446062269,Jason,ok
1446062272,Hope,so we've already been up here
1446062275,Jason,doesn't it make you want to march?
1446062278,Ashley,do you want to march?
1446062281,Jason,a little
1446062305,Hope,livetrekker had it's own ideas for where we're gonna go
1446062308,Ashley,well it keeps jumping around which is the problem I had before it stopped working
1446062311,Hope,* yea
1446062314,Hope,it's working fine on andy's phone
1446062317,Ashley,will spotify play if you're not looking at it?

1446062365,Hope,yea we're coming up right here on
1446062368,Ashley,ok
1446062371,Jason,wait weren't we just here
1446062374,Hope,oh wait wait wait
1446062377,Ashley,I knew we had to go back or something
1446062380,Hope,* this way yea
1446062383,Hope,that sixth up there? yea
1446062386,Ashley,that is sixth
1446062389,Hope,ok
1446062392,Ashley,this is capitol
1446062395,Hope,yep so we can take a left here and then we looks like we cut across along this
1446062425,Hope,through the arcade I guess is maybe is that where that's going?
1446062428,Ashley,the arcade would be 2 blocks.. another block further
1446062431,Hope,* oh yea you're right
1446062434,Hope,so this goes about half way up capitol
1446062437,Ashley,the area around the capitol building is like a circle
1446062440,Hope,ok
1446062443,Ashley,so we could be just looping around it
1446062446,Hope,looks like we're goin
1446062449,Hope,or we could just walk over to the next point which is on sixth
1446062452,Ashley,whatever you want to do
1446062455,Ashley,this we shall overcome video is trying to convince me that I should be doing more
1446062458,Hope,here's a picture that actually comes up picketers mostly college students in front of the cross keys restaurant from march 30th
1446062485,Jason,so do you think cross keys is gone now?
1446062488,Hope,* we can
1446062491,Jason,* we got caesars

1446062503,Hope,this at least gets us over to sixth
1446062506,Hope,ours was at least easy to follow cuz it was straight up and back (laughing)
1446062509,Jason,to the left now?
1446062512,Hope,I think it looks like it's slightly down there's some there there looks like a plaque or something
1446062545,Hope,just over here or maybe right here
1446062548,Jason,(laughing)
1446062551,Jason,are we still on the path?
1446062554,Hope,maybe it's back the opposite direction looks like it goes.. that's sixth and
1446062557,Hope,was it at the hermitage hotel?
1446062560,Ashley,this next song is woke up this morning by the freedom singers

1446062671,Hope,I'm not sure which cross keys I'm guessing is what they're referencing
1446062674,Jason,presumably it was in this neighborhood
1446062677,Hope,is that is right there I think
1446062680,Meghan,us in relation to (inaudible)
1446062683,Hope,I think so this is the wherever that sign is.. so
1446062725,Jason,was it cool that she was able to take the perspective of.. the owner like not understand that he had his reasons to like and wasn't necessarily a cruel person.. he just worked hard and wanted
1446062728,Ashley,* either way
1446062731,Hope,guess 221 that might have been where is that looks close
1446062734,Hope,here's an actual picture of the sit in movement
1446062737,Jason,wait who are they dumping food on?

1446063214,Hope,yea she's a famous civil rights activist

1446063220,Jason,* oh
1446063223,Hope,starting to make more sense considering the first exercise where we literally had no context whatsoever
1446063226,Jason,yea yea

1446063268,Ashley,they um maggie and allie were with you

1446063274,Ashley,* right there

1446063898,Hope,yea they're doing something there like there must be some other event happening
1446063901,Ashley,I took a good double decker bus tour of nashville and it told me that is the cheapest place to park on weekends
1446063925,Hope,* the public square garage?
1446063928,Jason,* court hotel
1446063931,Ashley,yea

1446064000,Hope,alright
1446064045,Hope,should we like walk around or I don't know are we allowed to walk through here I guess we can
1446064048,Jason,I wonder what they're are they taking down or setting up
1446064051,Ashley,setting up
1446064054,Hope,I think they're setting something up it looks like a ceremony cuz of the chairs that are out or maybe a concert I don't know
1446064057,Jason,I know
1446064060,Ashley,maybe something with the symphony
1446064063,Jason,those guys look like they could be important
1446064066,Ashley,do you want to ask them hey are you important
1446064069,Jason,no nah
1446064105,Hope,knowing what we know about what happened on jefferson street I wouldn't call that first sentence to be the most accurate historical statement in the world
1446064108,Jason,* yea civility
1446064111,Jason,so white people who didn't like desegregation bombed the councilman's house
1446064165,Ashley,I think so
1446064168,Jason,or office or whatever
1446064171,Hope,looks like the next stop is.. davidson county criminal court and jail
1446064174,Ashley,which is that way right it's like around the building
1446064177,Hope,yes
1446064180,Ashley,we are almost at the end of the playlist
1446064183,Hope,and we're almost at the end of the tour to few two more stops
1446064186,Ashley,what so did they not include the library gallery in their tour at all?
1446064189,Hope,good question does does not look like it.. uh maybe we can go back by there considering we didn't have any context with the notes and things
1446064285,Jason,is that it?
1446064288,Hope,I can see where these two pictures are here
1446064291,Jason,oh
1446064294,Hope,come on livetrekker
1446064297,Jason,so if I got thrown in jail this is where I would go
1446064300,Ashley,I think so
1446064303,Hope,uh potentially the I'm not sure they like housed people here permanently but maybe
1446064306,Jason,I don't know
1446064309,Ashley,there's normally a temporary jail right next to the courthouse
1446064312,Hope,yes I think that's what this is for sure so this is I'm guessing where they threw people like after the sit in movement who they arrested for civil unrest or whatever
1446064315,Jason,cool
1446064318,Hope,and there's two more text blurbs here but still no dice
1446064321,Jason,the first studio society is justice
