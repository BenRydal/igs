Whole Class,388,"Okay, you guys have three minutes. Three minutes. See if you can figure this one out. Three minutes. Okay."
Whole Class,477,I am going to start stamping in about 30 seconds. So I need something written down. Something written down.
Student,484,"H, what's your warmup paper? Put your binder down. Warm up of paper. Okay. Solve it."
Whole Class,513,I need to see something on your paper?
Student,569,"L binder. It's not over there. Get a piece of paper. Blank piece of paper's over there in the, yeah, I got sheet in the thing."
Student,581,"What do you think, M? What's a hamburger?"
Student,595,"Write it down. Write it down. Okay,"
Student,602,Paper over there.
Group,606,"Sorry guys. Oh, I missed your whole table. Did you grab it?"
Student,616,What's the burrito? It's 10?
Student,629,It's five.
Group,630,She thinks it's five.
Whole Class,641,"Okay, let's go over this. Okay, hamburgers, how much are the hamburgers?"
Whole Class,652,"Four each. How so? It's four and four. So the total is eight, right? Eight and eight. So here we have eight and eight. How much is the burrito? 10. Five. Yeah. So two burritos is 10. 10, one burrito is, what's the soup?"
Whole Class,680,"Okay. And this is two burritos. Soup is a and hamburger is eight. No, I messed up. So what's this one is eight, and this is what? Four. So what's the final answer? So eight times four is ... plus 10 ...42. Okay, good. Thank you."
Whole Class,715,"Okay, so we're going to pass out our paper today. I know yesterday we were reviewing linear functions because it's been a while since we did 'em since our break. Okay, you grab, as you get your paper, put your name on it and start reading that first little paragraph about Ms.Woodman and her pool. And circle the important information. So as you get your paper, go ahead and put your name on it and start reading your problem."
Student,771,"I think I gave you an extra one. Just leave it there. Oops. How much did I give you? 1, 2, 3."
Whole Class,782,Does everybody have paper?
Whole Class,800,Okay. So you're reading the problem right now by yourself since circling the important information.
Student,816,"Oh, they're somewhere over there, A. Somewhere over there. Let's throw that in trash. Sure. Let's go this way."
Whole Class,846,"Okay, so you should have circled some important information. Okay? So let's read this together now. So we have Ms. Woodman is filling up a plastic swimming pool in her backyard, okay? So she can throw a pool party. She places a hose in the pool and it starts filling with water at a constant rate of what? What's the constant rate here? ... 20 gallons per what?"
Whole Class,880,Per hour? Minute. So every minute 20 gallons are getting filled in the pool. When is a pool full?
Whole Class,893,"At 300 gallons. Okay. So you have a constant rate of 20 gallons per minute. And the pool is full when it reaches 300 gallons. Okay, so you're going to work well first, does anybody have any questions about this situation? You have a pool with water, right? Water being filled in the water goes in here at 20 gallons per minute. Okay? It's full when it reaches 300. So with your team, I want you to answer questions. Let's do one through four right now. One through four. Okay? So take time, take about seven minutes questions, one through four, and I'll get some of you to do the problems on here. Okay? So work with your teams one through four."
Student,970,"Okay? H, how much water in the pool after five minutes?"
Student,983,Write it down.
Student,990,"Okay, how much water in the pool after five minutes?"
Student,997,Share your work. How'd you get that?
Whole Class,1012,"Make sure you're showing your work for one and two, please."
Student,1017,How'd you get?
Student,1020,"Okay, show your work. Show your work."
Whole Class,1028,"okay, make sure you're showing your work. I see a lot of correct answers, but not work."
Group,1052,"When you guys are done with this one, make sure, because you have same answers, but different ways, okay? To do it. So make sure you compare answers when you're done."
Student,1087,focus
Student,1090,Yep. Check your -- I want to see your work there.
Pair,1109,"What about, okay, for this one, so it says interval 10 or zero to 25. I need to see some lines here. How much water is it going to be in the pool in 20 minutes?"
Pair,1125,But the pool can only hold 300.
Pair,1128,So it'll overflow. So would it just stay?
Student,1139,(checking st paper) No P just 40.
Student,1144,Okay. Same with yours. You want the interval from zero to 25. Right now your interval is from zero to 15.
Student,1157,Is it? Because how much can the pool hold up to three Up to 300. So what's going to happen after it reaches 300? Is it going to go to 301. 302?
Group,1174,"So talk about that when you guys get here. So I know when you get to the graph, I want the graph to go all the way to 25. Okay? She has half of it, correct? I need to see where else does it go? Is it going to decrease in water? No."
Group,1195,What happens? It can't overfill. Okay. Share your answer with your team.
Whole Class,1213,"okay, is there anybody that wants to write the answer for number one? Anybody? Anybody?"
Student,1231,"Yes, that's right."
Student,1236,"You are today. Okay. I want you to write it though on this Side here. Okay? Write it on this side here, because I'm going to have somebody else. The other different method. There's two methods. Does somebody in your table have the different method?"
Student,1264,Why are we checking our grades right now? Okay. iPad away. Come on.
Group,1281,So how was your graph?
Student,1291,"Okay, X, finish your graph with your graph."
Student,1298,"H. H. Okay, for this one, let me see."
Group,1303,"Okay, so here it overflows, right? So if it's overflowing, what's happening to the water? Is it going to..."
Group,1312,It's going out. But does it get more full or does it stay at 300?
Group,1326,Share it with your team.
Student,1338,Yes. Why? Why does it go like this?
Student,1344,What? Stays
Student,1347,Okay. And the interval is from zero to 25 minutes. So continue your line until five minutes and share it with your team.
Pair,1354,"You two, both of you, because you guys have the answer for that one. Share it with your team. Okay?"
Whole Class,1380,Okay. I am going to stop you in about 15 seconds. I want to discuss number one for a bit.
Student,1392,Wait for your team. You can compare it with your team. What's your domain here?
Whole Class,1409,"Okay, so I need your attention over here and put your pencils down in 5, 4, 3, 2, and one. Okay, so here's one solution, right? So how much water is in the pool after five minutes of filling? So we have a hundred gallons and S. How did you get a hundred gallons? I just rolled it by"
Whole Class,1430,"And 5 times 20 equals 100. Now did somebody use function notation that wants to write and share their answer? So this is a great way of using it. That's completely fine. There is another method here and P's going to write it down. So if you didn't do this method, you could write it on the side. So you have two methods on there, okay? If P you didn't use this method, that P's going to write, just write it on the side so you have this explanation too."
Student,1472,"Thank you, P"
Whole Class,1482,"Okay, so write, if you didn't use this method here, write it on the side. It's exactly the same thing. We're just using function notation."
Student,1527,"Yeah, go ahead And do the graph."
Whole Class,1530,"Okay, so let's talk about both of these. What's the main difference between this one and this one? What's one difference that you see? Yes, J."
Whole Class,1544,It simplified. Do you think this one's more simple than this one?
Whole Class,1547,"the function notation. Okay, where did this 20 come from? Yes M"
Whole Class,1556,"The rate and where does T come from? This variable. T, what does this stand for? I heard it over here. What does it stand for?"
Whole Class,1565,"Time. Time and minutes, right? We have a rate of 20 with five minutes and it's just the same thing. 20 times five, which is 100. Okay, so who wants to do number two? You can keep working, but I'm going to start writing the answers on the board, okay? So you can double check. You did number one already. Who wants to do number number two?"
Whole Class,1587,J wants to do number two?
Student,1593,This one...Yeah
Whole Class,1605,"I know some of you're finishing up number five, some of you're still working on number five. Okay, you should be hopefully on number five."
Student,1634,"C. Lemme see how you did, see how you did This one. Okay,"
Student,1645,"Is that right? What do we think? I think ...yes, S? I go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom."
Student,1654,You can
Pair,1656,Is he right?
Pair,1660,What do we think?
Pair,1663,"Why would you put 20,"
Student,1668,"So if you want to show the work, yeah, but here you're writing. What are you saying here?"
Student,1675,"Times, right? Yeah, that's good."
Student,1685,Mmhmm.
Whole Class,1685,Who wants to do number three? Three. Three. Anybody? Or I'm going to get someone.
Student,1694,You're going to do number three because you keep being on your phone.
Student,1702,Number three.
Whole Class,1724,"Okay, so take a moment to look at two and three. We're not going to spend a lot of time on it. We're going to move on to the graph in a bit."
Student,1747,No? Yes Sir.
Whole Class,1783,"Okay, let's go over. So we have two. So how long does it take until the pool gets full? 15 minutes. Okay, and P(2)... So it represents how much water there is in two minutes. How much water is in the pool in two minutes? So make sure you write P(2) equals what?"
Whole Class,1813,"20. Okay, so we should all be on the graph. Even if you're in the back, I want you to go back to the front so we can talk about this graph. Okay? So I want a sketch. The graph P over the interval, zero to 25 minutes. Okay, so at zero minutes, how much water is in the pool?"
Whole Class,1836,None in five minutes. How much water is in the pool?
Whole Class,1844,Five minutes? How much water in the pool?
Whole Class,1849,A hundred. In 10 minutes. How much water?
Whole Class,1856,"200. And in 15 minutes, how much water? Okay, so when I was walking around, I saw this here. (extends line past 15 minutes)"
Whole Class,1879,"Okay, pretend that that line is not, we're just going to freehand it. Okay? So what happens after the pool gets full? What happens in the next minute if we keep putting water in it? Well,"
Whole Class,1895,"but the maximum it could go is 300. So in 20 minutes, how much water's in the pool?"
Whole Class,1907,300. Why?
Whole Class,1912,"It's the max it can go, right? And then 25 minutes, how much water's in the pool?"
Whole Class,1919,"300. Okay, so I saw a lot of you explain this line as straight (highlights the constant interval of the graph). What's another way to call this line when it's going this way?"
Whole Class,1931,Constant. It's a constant line. So what's going on here? What's happening to the water? What's the story here? It's... What do we call this one? It's
Whole Class,1944,Increasing until when? What minute does it stop increasing?
Whole Class,1951,"Till 15 till 300 on the Y. 15 minutes. 15 minutes and then it becomes what? ... Constant until how many minutes? ... 25. Okay, any questions about that? Okay, turn it around and let's take about 10 minutes to finish. Five through 12. I know some of you already started, make sure you're talking with your groups. Five through 12."
Student,2000,"Okay, this one right here. What's your domain? I know you want to put, I know it stops increasing at 15, but that's not where our domain stops. Where does it stop?"
Student,2018,Okay. Oops. Share it with your group. Make sure everybody has that domain.
Student,2029,What's our domain? N?
Student,2036,How many minutes are we measuring here? What does it say?
Student,2042,"Okay, write that down and then share that with M."
Student,2055,"You could do that way, but you can also just look at the rate. You have your equation here already,"
Student,2069,"Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, you're going to have two to describe one to describe this one, what you have and another one. Describe the straight line. It's constant line,"
Student,2085,"Okay, make sure you share it with your team."
Student,2091,"Okay, C, wake up. Wake up domain."
Group,2096,What's the domain here? What is the domain?
Student,2104,"The what? What's the domain? C, what's the domain here?"
Group,2109,What are we describing here? The minutes or the gallons? What's the domain? The minutes. So look at your graph. What minutes are we graphing here? Between what numbers?
Group,2125,"Paragraph starts over here. Oh, zero to 25. Okay, you can keep going on the next problem. Do you need help with that?"
Student,2134,"C? Okay, so we have a piece wise function, we'll get more into what that is later, but can you write two equations to describe this? You see these two equations here?"
Student,2155,"If I told you to write an equation with this story without the graph, what would you write it?"
Student,2164,"Well, what's your start?"
Student,2168,How much water are we starting off with?
Student,2171,Zero. And what's our rate?
Student,2174,So what's your equation going to be? ...
Student,2182,20. What? You need a variable in there?
Student,2187,Okay. That's one equation
Student,2192,Good.
Group,2196,Help 'em out. They're just... okay. They're going to help you out. Help 'em out. Yes.
Student,2212,You can use that. That's fine.
Student,2216,Okay. C off the phone. Not locked in right here. C's not locked in. Are you locked in? I just
Student,2223,"Okay, who's going to help you out? Who's your team? I"
Group,2230,Look. Look. SC can help you out right here. Explain the graph to him. I
Group,2235,"Explain. Wait, wait. Why is it going like that? Why is the graph drawn out like that?"
Group,2242,Yes it is. I just want you to explain it to him.
Group,2250,Why is it going into a straight line?
Group,2257,"So you guys, why is it going in a straight line? Yeah guys,"
Group,2264,Can it get more full than 300?
Group,2269,Exactly. Good job.
Student,2282,What interval is P? Increasing.
Pair,2285,What did you get? A?
Pair,2290,Why did you put zero to 15?
Pair,2299,Good job.
Group,2300,"Okay, about this table."
Student,2313,Are you sure that's the range right here? What's the range of the pool? Measuring the water.
Group,2321,So what's the lowest point the water's going to be at?
Group,2325,And what's the highest point The water's going to be at
Group,2328,300
Student,2330,Yes.
Pair,2334,Have your team check it! T? No. Check this for him. Is he right? There's something.
Group,2342,"Okay, they're right, but there's something a little wrong with it. The answers"
Group,2348,Domain is what?
Group,2353,"What's the domain? No, no, that's not what I'm not concerned."
Group,2358,So what do you have for the domain? A?
Group,2363,"Yes, but it's continuous. So how are we going to write it?"
Group,2368,The box brackets. And what's your lowest number? Zero. And what's your highest number? 25.
Group,2378,Why is it 25 and not 15?
Group,2387,It's got to flip them. So domain measures what? The minutes or the water? Your domain is the
Student,2415,"Yes,"
Student,2420,"I'm writing to you. Okay, you have one equation already because you wrote it down on the board. You have one equation."
Student,2432,What's your equation to describe here? The situation?
Student,2436,"That's fine. It doesn't, the letters don't matter. So you have one equation, you have the equation that describes this. What equation are you going to write to describe that?"
Student,2448,E. E E. We're not saying hi to people.
Whole Class,2482,"Okay, I'm going to have, let's start going over these because we got like 10 more minutes. Okay? Does somebody want to write some of the answers? Anybody, any volunteers writing some answers?"
Whole Class,2502,"Okay, I'm going to choose somebody."
Student,2504,"Okay? C, you're right here. Okay, do. Okay. This one, I want you to do it like this with these brackets. Okay? So copy one, two and 3 -- 5, 6 and 7."
Whole Class,2520,"Okay, so we have the answers to five, six, and seven going on the board. So double check your answers."
Student,2531,Some something wrong with this one.
Student,2532,"P, there's something wrong with your domain."
Student,2539,"Okay, share that with P. Share that with P."
Student,2547,"Okay, what's your domain here? I know you were gone for a bit."
Group,2552,"Okay, C, flip the paper over. L, flip the paper over."
Group,2564,"Okay. Yes, the domain."
Student,2567,"Gallon time. Galling time. Exactly. No, you're right. Gallon time."
Student,2572,But but I'm looking for this.
Student,2579,"Okay, thank you Chase."
Student,2585,"Okay, F keep going. Do you understand what that one's asking? Where is it increasing? Where is it increasing? What numbers? Look at your graph."
Student,2602,The water.
Student,2603,The minutes. Yeah. Where is it increasing from? Zero to
Student,2613,"Not 300. We're not measuring the range, we're measuring the domain."
Student,2617,Zero. Is it increasing all the way over here?
Student,2621,Zero to 15.
Whole Class,2624,"Okay, so we have here, we have our domain from zero to 25 and zero to 300, and it stops at 300 because that's the max amount the pool can hold, right? S? Yes. Yes. Okay, so I'm going to give a moment."
Group,2646,"Let me see. A. Okay, you're going to do 8, 9, 10"
Group,2651,"Yes. 8, 9, 10. I have you. Were going to get 11, but we're going to do that together."
Student,2663,You're good. You have it?
Student,2666,Yes.
Student,2669,What's yours?
Group,2674,"Good job. Yeah. Okay, so share it around. And then J, you got saved."
Whole Class,2681,"Okay, so move on to number eight."
Student,2686,When is it increasing? When's the interval increasing?
Student,2694,Zero to...
Student,2698,Zero to 15. Good job.
Group,2701,"Okay, I know some of you have stopped on."
Student,2704,"If you want the water to decrease, what are you going to do?"
Student,2712,"Take the water out. Good job. Okay,"
Whole Class,2760,"Okay. So because of time, I do want to go over the last ones. So we have on what interval is P increasing? So if we go back to our graph, when is it increasing? What interval? Between one and what minute is it increasing?"
Whole Class,2780,"Zero to 15. Okay, so that's why here it's increasing by zero to 15 on what interval? Let's do the number nine really fast. On what interval is it being constant?"
Whole Class,2794,15 to 25.
Whole Class,2798,"We won't talk about that. Okay, what would I have to do to this pool to decrease the water?"
Whole Class,2805,"Drain it. Okay, now before we go, I want to talk about 11 real quick. So we have, how many lines do we have here? How many different lines do we see? Two. We have one that's increasing and one that's constant. Okay, so what's the equation for this one? I know we haven't written equations in a while. What's the, remember we do Y equals M X plus B. What's our Y intercept? Zero. Zero. What's our rate? 20 x. So our equation here is Y equals 20 x. Okay, that's one. What's the other equation? Y equals what? 300. Okay, so we have two equations. So Y equals 300 table phone away. Okay, so Y equals, so we have this equation that the Y equals 20 x and then we have this purple one here. Okay? And that is, don't start packing up yet. You'll have time to pack up. This is y equals 300."
Whole Class,2923,"So on which interval does this one work? When is this one active? Zero to 15. Oh, we right it here. The first equation is zero to 15. And when is this one active here? 15 to 25. Okay. Tomorrow we're going to do the second part of this, which I'm going to show you how to write it in this beautiful format. Okay, that's tomorrow. But you guys going to start putting your stuff away."
Whole Class,2955,"Take your names and throw 'em in the trash, please take your names and throw 'em in the trash. Okay? This table."
