Probe,197,"[…] Wait, what's that? What's that graph of? That's a graph of what? [...] That seems like acceleration to me. Okay. "
Evaluation,327,"Good, good, good, good, good guys, I really wanted to see you guys interact. This is why I'm really excited to watch it. All right, thank you."
Evaluation,379,I probably should have just left you guys cuz you would've got it right on the next one. Once you saw the next problem. I think you would've gotten
Evaluation,389,"Good. Good, good, good. Good,"
Evaluation,392,Good. That's good.
Probe,695,"Well, what'd you get?"
Probe,699,"Said Sure, I know you're right. And she said she believed in me and we got that on camera and I was super happy. But, but there's, but I'd rather, we use some math. So how do we know how far I went? Because basically, right, this is my velocity, right? And time five is right here. Right? Which you already said. Cuz this is when I stopped. So, um, what happens here? Do you know? Did you read the story?"
Probe,718,"Just, why?"
Probe,722,"It doesn't say it's just, well,"
Probe,728,"Apartment, something like that. I lent the bike to my friend in, in U C S B. Yeah. So what I'm thinking is like, I stayed there for a little while. Like maybe I talked to him or something, right? Maybe we had some lunch or something like that. You get me what you mean? Point is like, I, I'm, I'm assuming that this would be when I got to Santa Barbara. So how, how far did I go? Like this is the velocity graph. Like what can you do? What math can we do?"
Probe,764,"Area? Find an area. The area, right? So what is the area"
Probe,770,"Okay, that's a good estimation. Sure. But you could do better than that. <laugh>. What is the area right here?"
Probe,779,"We're talking about like all like zero to five. Okay. 80, right? 80 here because it's four hours, 20 miles an hour, right? Yeah. Okay. And then what about this"
Probe,795,"This is a triangle. How far, how far is this right here? Uh, you guys have got it? You got it now? You got it. Find out the number."
Evaluation,857, Nice.
Press for justification,871,"Stop laughing at me. Is it right? I know I could. Oh, you want me to show your awesome work? All I mean, you're doing it. Perfect. So is it right? Yes. How do you know?"
Press for justification,891,"You right, you're"
Press for justification,894,That's right. We caught that on camera.
Press for justification,941,How do you know that? It's more than 80?
Press for justification,945,You found the area? Yeah. What was the area?
Press for justification,949,"Okay, then you must have known like, it's kind of silly. Like"
Press for justification,954,"This question asked you zero to three, which was 60, right? Because it's three hours times 20 miles per hour. And then this one is asking you the rest of the time, and you just said it was 90, so it must be 30. But also this is 10. This is 20 again because it's another one times 20, right? But this is a triangle. So this triangle has a base of one, a height of 20. So 20 times one times one half because it's, and that's your 10. So that's your 30, that's your 20 plus 10, right? Good job on that one too."
Evaluation,1009,"Good, good. "
Redirect,1019,Let me see what you guys let me see. 103?
Redirect,1027,"Wait, two 50. Where'd you get that?"
Redirect,1033,You forgot. You forgot something. You forgot something.
Redirect,1036,You don't need to show any calculations.
Redirect,1048,"Oh, I know what you did. Look, I'll show you. So remember when you did this one? You, you did it right? Four to five 20 T plus a hundred, right? Yeah."
Redirect,1061,"Right? It was two 50 minus two 40. Great. And you used that two 50 for,"
Redirect,1066,"For this answer because you were thinking zero to five. But remember that the cur that um, equation that I gave you is a negative 20. Yeah. Cause it's negative slope, right? You're now pretending like that was the equation the whole time. Which would be, it would go, it would be way more area. Does that make sense? But it wasn't that before that it was just this 80. So that's why I said don't even try to calculate it because it would be hard cuz it's peace wise. But if you just treat it as it was, as if it was dysfunction the whole time, it would go all the way back up to like a really high number. Now you have a giant triangle that's way too many miles. So what I was thinking was, that's why I said don't calculate it. What you know the answer to this because this is just my displacement on the five hours, which is what?"
Redirect,1112,You did this problem already.
Redirect,1115,"<laugh>. Well think about it though, cuz you just got 10 for this and this is four hours and 20 months. 90 is this one, right? This 90. Yeah. So this is, so that's why I said don't calculate it cuz it's hard. You could do it, but you would have to do two equations in Adam together. Does that make sense?"
Evaluation,1180,"Check. What number 1 0 1. No, it looks good. No, you're right. Everything's right. Whoa."
Redirect,1190,That's good. What? Let me see. 1 0 3. What does it say?
Redirect,1206,It's just asking you for the velocity.
Redirect,1220,Negative 12. That sounds right.
Evaluation,1226,<laugh>. You got it. You're good. All
Redirect,1265,"Just look at it. Um, 1 0 3 is not, I don't wanna say anything on camera."
Redirect,1273,"It's wrong! You know, I'm just kidding. Um, I, I, you know what? I don't know what you're thinking about. It's just"
Redirect,1280,"Is wrong about it? Oh, actually that's interesting. But that velocity equation is only, see, look, let me show all of you. It's important. This is, uh, different people are making mistakes on this same idea. The velocity equation that I gave you here is only for the interval. Yeah. Because right from zero to four it's 20. This, this is a piece size function. I just didn't ever give you any equations. The only equation I give you was for this piece, it has a negative 20 slope. I promise you the y intercept is positive 100. We can use point slope form or something if we wanted to find that. So that's only for that piece. So if you wanna find the velocity at eight, you should just use the graph or you have to write another equation for the other piece. So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pieces. These two are kind of tricky. There are other, all the rest are constant. So that's easy. But you can use the graph to answer that question. Yeah, you get it."
Evaluation,1345,"Good, good. "
Probe,1351, Yeah. But why four though?
Probe,1366,"Yep. Good, good, good, good,"
Redirect,1389,"Just flying by. Nothing. Nothing, huh? Yeah. Negative 12. Yeah. Um, my velocity's not decreasing. It's just negative. What? I wonder what that means. I don't know. It's, there's more problems. Yeah."
Press for justification,1423,"Uh, I mean negative 90 looks like why would negative 90 be a good answer?"
Press for justification,1431,And why 90?
Press for justification,1436,Just one. Yeah. So what then where will I be at the end?
Extend student thinking,1452,"Huh? Um, I would say I'm not turning back. I'm, I'm going back, but I heard you say, but like, where did I turn back?"
Extend student thinking,1470,"Seven's a good answer I think. Cuz I went forward and then I stayed there for a little while. Like, let's say that I didn't just like grab my bike and run. I like talked to my friend or maybe we had a sandwich or something. Right? And then I, and then I went back here. And so by the time I get to eight, I'm not turning back. I'm already been going back. Oh. Does that make sense? All right. Good though. Good stuff."
Evaluation,1495, I agree with anything. Yeah. Good. Uhhuh. Good. Nick? 1 0 5. Brilliant. Good. That's great. That looks great.
Evaluation,1504, Good. That's great. That looks great.
Redirect,1557,"And in that one, I see what you did miles per hour. That's the right units. But like, I think, oh yeah, a lot of people are doing this. So this is, um, this is piece wise my velocity, right? And it starts out at 20 from zero to four and then it's negative. It's this, the equation that you used, it's that negative 20 T plus a hundred from four to five, which is what I said on the, when I gave you that equation. But then is zero for a while, right? Zero. Like you got that in your first problem. I don't know where to put the equal science. Whatever. Someone's gonna question my math on the, oh then. So that's that piece that, that's here and then a zero and then it's something else. It's not still this. So to use this equation for eight, you can't do that cuz you're not on this piece anymore when you get to time eight. Right? So I would just say use the graph to calculate the velocity, not the equation. Cuz the equation is only true for four to five. Right? Later on, I'm gonna make you write the equation for this. And when you plug in eight, you'll get the right answer. But for now, you have, you see it? Yeah. You get it. It's, yeah. Negative."
Evaluation,1657,"No, it's great. I'm loving you. You, you all are so great. Put that on record. You kind of got that, you knew it already, right? Good. Brilliant. You don't need Mr. To"
Evaluation,1676,"Good, good. Like your style. Negative miles. Ah, interesting."
Evaluation,1695," Good, good, good, good, good. "
Evaluation,1745,"Negative 28? I don't think it was ever negative 28. What's negative 28. What's 1 0 6 a only To's logic. Oh, how'd you get? 28?"
Evaluation,1775,Just one more time. 24 and six is what?
Evaluation,1778,"It's 30 on camera. Got em. You it, perfect. You did the math perfectly. <laugh>, that's, you gotta change both <laugh>. Okay, anyway. 40 for that one. I, I, I messed up too. So don't, don't don't, don't sweat it."
Extend student thinking,1802,"Because that's my position, right? So I started at zero and after two hours, like we go back to the graph, right? I messed up because it, it, it, it after. Oh, I just messed up everything. Help me. Any <laugh> guess right there. No, it's not this one. I know, I know, I know, I know. I'm trying to get this back too at the same time. Okay, so now I have um, uh, yeah, 0, 0, 0, right? Because I started in Malibu. Yeah. And then two is supposed to be 40. You know that cuz it was two hours of 20 miles an hour. So this is supposed to be"
Extend student thinking,1835,"Is 90, you're right. And 10 is, I think you're right. 10 is 30. No, 10 is not 30. This is 30, right? Yeah. But that's, this is very important. It's like, I don't know how to say this. I don't wanna mess it up. I want you to think about it a little bit more. This is 90, right? This like, I have more to go, right? We're cutting it off at 10. How much is this? 30? But you put negative 30. So let's say negative 30. So what is my, okay, I gotta go. Okay. This is supposed to be 40. I messed up because it's two hours times 20, right? So that was my bad. No, no, you're right. You're right. Only I'm wrong. <laugh> good. You awesome. Too easy. Too"
Redirect,1943,"Yeah. Let, I'm gonna stop you there, even though I'm sorry. So you're doing great and you're gonna get 250 minus and this is gonna be zero. I'll do it fast for you. But then that means 250 miles after five hours. That's not good. Cuz I didn't Oh, go 250 miles. I only went 90 miles. So what's wrong? But this is a mistake. A lot of people have been making this graph looks like this. And then it looks like this, right? Yeah. And if you use this equation, this equation is only good from four to five. It's the line with the decreasing slope. That's why it's negative 20 slope. Like the y-intercept is 100 way up there somewhere. So what you're doing is right, if I follow this line back to zero, I get a giant triangle and that's gonna be 250 miles. Oh, but it wasn't like that. It was 40 here, right? So I think you already didn't you already get 10? Oh, I'm sorry. No, this was four times 20. This was 80. Yeah. So didn't you already get 10 there? And then the, so the answer is just 90. That's why I said you don't have to calculate it because if you do, you would have to break it up into two. I didn't want you to do all that. Okay, that makes sense. So it's just 90 just to know that that means, what it means is 90 is what I wanted from that problem. Okay, good."
Evaluation,2034,"It's done. Or what? You're like farthest ahead. I knew you had it in you. Ah, all <laugh>. And when the cameras come"
Evaluation,2045,"All right. All right. All right. For real though, what is this?"
Evaluation,2050,That's not right.
Evaluation,2055,Don't say that unless you're the green marker.
Evaluation,2059,"Well, you shouldn't say that. Okay. Where, where are we at? 1 0 8. 1 0 8. 1 0 8. Okay. 1 0 8."
Extend student thinking,2075,"You want to do this, you have to be able to take the anti derivative or you just know that this is gonna be the same as the area under that curve. So you could just find the area. Yes. So that five to seven is my whole way home, right? You already, you already calculated this. What was it?"
Extend student thinking,2126,"Now in this one, I do want you to do some calculating. In order to do the calculation of this part, it's kind of hard. You have to actually write the equation for this piece of the line, which is a little tricky. You gotta, but you're good at that cuz we, we know how to do like point slope. This mm-hmm. <affirmative> you. You'll figure it out."
Evaluation,2166,"Do you have any questions? Negative miles don't exist. Okay, cool. I dig in. All right. All right."
Evaluation,2179,"Yes, that's right. Can"
Extend student thinking,2181,"Um, well let me think about that. Anyone?"
Extend student thinking,2205,"Miles. Miles. I think it's miles. Good. Wait, uh, this is, this is right-ish, but this is, so I think this is negative 30. But then where does that put me? Where's my position? Position? Negative 30, 60."
Redirect,2243,"Okay. You did it again. Ah, I'm sorry. Remember I said that equation only lasts for that little part? Oh my god. So, so it's the same problem. So you can't plug it in here either cuz when you get to eight, you're here, right? And you're not on that piece of equation anymore. This has a different slope and a different y intercept and it's totally different. So just use the graph. What's the velocity? That is the velocity graph. What is the velocity right there?"
Redirect,2272,"Yeah. So that's all you have to do. You can't use the equation cuz it's not that piece of, of function."
Redirect,2300,"This is not okay, this is not velocity. When you find the area to be negative 30, that means he, he like, he traveled too. Yeah. So like, he tells us that he traveled what, 30 miles back? Yeah. Good. 30 miles back. Great. Brilliant. Okay, now this, um, uhoh, I'm confused here where two 40 come from."
Redirect,2330,"And then, right. But remember, same thing, this is piece wise. So you can't, you can only plug in, you can only do anti derivative for like four to five. You can't, cuz it's, it's the same problem. You're like doing the same thing."
Redirect,2346,"Sure. Or area geometry style. Yeah. But it's still the same. Look, six is I'm here. Right? What's going on here? Right. I rode 90 miles to get to Santa Barbara and I'm chilling for a couple hours. So what's my position?"
Redirect,2362,"90. 90, right? I'm just chilling there. Like, because this was 90, I call it accumulation. Like I accumulated 90 miles worth of area or 90 miles worth of travel. Right. And now I'm staying there. Right. And then what happens is I go back 30. That's, that's 10 right there. So what's my position at 10 60? Exactly. Cuz that would be the 90 or plus the negative 30. Does that make sense? And the only way to do it with anti derivatives is you have to have an equation, which I am gonna ask you at the end. But right now we're still like, okay, we're doing negative, negative area. This is kind of interesting. There's no such thing as a negative area technically. But there is like going back, which you guys are picking up on, which is really"
Evaluation,2478,"You know, go ahead, finish. I'm gonna do my, I'm gonna do it my way. Go finish. Oh, you're done. Let's see what happens. You're right. I decided to use this point cause I thought it was a little easier because that, that line goes from this point to that point, right? Yeah. To this point."
evaluation,2500,"But you're doing perfect. Great job. That's a lot of people are gonna get stuck on that or I hope they're not, but they might for sure. Yep."
Evaluation,2531,"I have to Yeah, but I want you to do, I want you to show all your work. So that means you have to write the equation first or that line and then do the calculus."
Redirect,2582,"Oh man. <laugh>, what's going on now? Oh no. What are you doing? Which one?"
Redirect,2592,"One. Why this one? This one right here. Oh, I was gonna say, yeah, we're doing"
Redirect,2597,"<laugh>. No, don't tell me you're still using this equation. Yes. No, don't remember. That's not the equation. Only with that little piece. <laugh>. Okay. Same. You're just supposed to know that that's that. That's just that area. Yeah."
Redirect,2618,"It's 90. Okay. Oh, I don't know. I don't know that. That's"
Redirect,2627,"Okay, but what is it on 15?"
Redirect,2632,You go back. Yeah. The area. Yeah.
Redirect,2645,It's really funny. Times
Redirect,2656,"It's 84. But I think this is only six, right? Because it's the half. Yeah. So in 84,"
Redirect,2663,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, it's like this. But you just keep going further. So there was five more hours of negative 12 six. It's 60. No it's not six. Oh oh this is six. Yeah. But plus 84. What is that?"
Redirect,2676,90 or the negative 30 And another negative 60. What should it be? 90 or negative? 90.
Redirect,2685,"<laugh>. I think the answer right here is just negative 90. That's it. That's the answer. Because that's the area under the curve from seven to to 15, right? <laugh>. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. <laugh>. You guys are the best. Good. That's pretty good. What is that? A seven?"
Evaluation,2707,Yeah. Okay. You got it. Good job.
Redirect,2715,"What? So what'd you get? Negative 12. So much Good stuff. Let me think. Something feels wrong. I feel like it should be negative six. Isn't that little triangle right there? Have an area of negative six, but it's something small. You've done so much. Good. Oh, we forgot to do anti derivative."
Evaluation,2749,"Bro. Yeah, you just plugged into the derivative. So put"
Redirect,2753,"Did anti derivative. Yeah, you did velocity. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that actually is a change of velocity minus 12 miles per hour cuz it was zero miles. But we want the change of position. We wanna do the anti deriv. You forgot to do anti derivative. So you got the right equation. 12 x plus 84. Now you still gotta go. "
Evaluation,2775,"Dude, y'all awesome beasts. Yo, this is so good every day. No, I don't even care. Good job. You're amazing. Amazing. I'm so amazed. I'm not amazed. I'm just impressed."
Redirect,2789,"That doesn't look right. What are we doing? Oh yeah. So look, everybody's making this mistake. Eventually, I keep giving chances to trick you. This is good, right? This is how you did this. Problem is how you're doing this problem, right? But you've done everything else, right? So you haven't let this trick you. But see this is only the equation on four to five. So when you start using it for anything else, you're gonna be wrong because it's that piece of the function that goes down, right? That has a negative 20 slope plus a hundred. But then we have different equations, so we can't use that equation. But remember that this is just the same thing as the area. How do you spell area? Area under the curve equation from seven, five to, so just do it that way. Just use area instead of trying to use that because you can't use this because it's not the equation on that interval."
Redirect,2857,"Oh yeah it is. But um, don't write this. Just write that. V 10 T wait, yeah. Is 12 on that. I'm sorry. Negative 12 on that interval. So then, yeah, so then that gives you this. So don't put put that, it's just, that's the equation. Oh. Just like you found this hard to find equation. This is the easy find equation, but you only supposed"
Evaluation,2887,There it is. Woo. Good job.
Redirect,2930,"So seven to 10 is, this is seven. Like I had lunch with my friend, got my bike back and headed back. I"
Redirect,2939,"Yeah. Okay, I'll, I'll see you later."
Redirect,2944,What? I'll come back and check. Okay. What? Five? That can't be right. Oh no. He
Redirect,2960,"What happened? Wait a minute. This, what is this?"
Redirect,2969,"Classic wild mistake that kids make sometimes. This is the equation. This needs to be here. Where'd why'd you divide by 12? You factored out the 12 and then just got rid of it. Yeah,"
Redirect,2979,"That. That's only for like, if you're like solving or something. So this should be negative 12 T plus 84. You did the hard work to get the right equation that use it now. Now you know this is gonna be six. Yeah. And it's gonna be different. You can erase it. I took a picture already. That's fine."
Evaluation,3006,"It's good. Your board's gonna be filled up with brilliance. It's big numbers, but you're doing it right."
Evaluation,3033,No wait. Well I don't see the squared here. So maybe it was that.
Redirect,3046,"That's weird that it came out. Said wait, there's a seven there and an eight there. That seems suspicious. <laugh>, do you know what it's supposed to be?"
Redirect,3058,"Negative six. Negative six. I think we have a question. Yeah. Uhhuh,"
Redirect,3063,"The poisons? No. Area. You could, but you'd have to write both those equations and do two and derivatives. That'd be a lot of work. Just use area. You could, you could, would it pretty much make you do that later? So might as well. I don't know. It's up to you. Good. Negative 30. You're right. Does people understand that? Negative 30. Cool. Perfect. Beautiful. Great. Wait, what?"
Evaluation,3085,"Good. Negative 30. You're right. Does people understand that? Negative 30. Cool. Perfect. Beautiful. Great. Wait, what?"
Redirect,3113,Yeah. Which one? What is
Redirect,3117,"Oh yeah, we"
Redirect,3118,"Values. This is wrong, but you're on the right track now you're gonna go like, you're gonna use this equation because, but it's negative. Yeah. And so now it's like, remember the one you kept on wanting to use before? Yeah. Now you actually get to do it, but now you gotta do it with this one. Cuz this is the equation for that piece right there. So"
Redirect,3136,Now you do anti derivative and plugin. Does that make sense? Yeah.
Redirect,3145,"What happened here? Did you do this? It's supposed to be, it's not supposed to be. What's it supposed to be between seven and eight? It's this, right?"
Redirect,3163,"It's not zero. It's this part right here. Not 12. Really negative six. Yeah, I think negative. We'll see, that'd be cool if it comes out negative. Ooh, that'd be"
Redirect,3173,"But yeah, so you're wrong. So I don't know. But you're right. So your anti derivative is here. That's right. So it's just something with your plugging in."
Redirect,3182,"But it might be that you need parenthesis here. Yeah. Mr. Try it again. And you're plugging in. You did it, right? Yeah, of course. Ooh, wow. Okay. Remember how, okay, this came out to negative six. This came out to negative 84. So like, you're gonna"
Evaluation,3383,"Oh, you know what? Um, I don't know how you got negative here, but I think it's, cuz this is negative six and this is also negative six. Oh, there you go. Figured that out. Okay. Okay. I think, I think you're gonna get it this time. It looks good. "
Extend student thinking,3403,"Um, seven is not, oh yeah, seven is 90. So is six. Six is also 90. Look up 90 that whole time while I'm resting, right? Yeah. Okay. What do you need help with? Wait, you know this, you know this already because from here, remember it was negative six. So this will be 84. And then after that it's back 12 every hour. Right. You don't have to actually work it out. You, you?"
Redirect,3431,"Good job over there though. Oh, but you know what this is. Oh, this is, these are, wait, this is anti derivatives, right? Yeah. Why'd you do anti derivatives?"
Redirect,3440,"Is velocity. You should just do directly. Oh, this you meant position, but you know what's hard? Come back. Come back to that <laugh>. Well, it's like the last problem. I know you. Yeah, you can't, well I know this one is 90, but yeah, those are hard. 90. Those are hard finding Those C's are hard. Admit this is zero."
Evaluation,3465,"Because it's the Yeah, you're right. That one's zero. The other one's 90. Okay. We got cup already. One's the easy ones, but yeah."
Evaluation,3473,What is that? I don't know. What are we doing?
Evaluation,3479,Challenge. You're doing a challenge problem.
Evaluation,3482,"No, I'm just kidding. That's right. But what about is exactly, that would be hard. I would say let's, should we skip that one?"
Probe,3520,"What happened here? How come? Where's the answer? Oh,"
Evaluation,3526,Did you get it?
Evaluation,3531,Just plug in 15 and plug in eight. Right? Whatever. Yeah. Everything else is right. I think. What does that 1 0 9 say?
Extend student thinking,3545,"Oh, let me see. Oh, okay. But also, like, where am I?"
Extend student thinking,3559,Yeah. So I got back.
Redirect,3700,"Grab. No, it doesn't take that long. Um, you're right. See, it's not that bad. You just gotta plot some points. Okay. Um, but what happened here though?"
Redirect,3715,"Like yeah, I you, but zero to five was 90, right? Uhhuh."
Redirect,3721,"So I don't know how you got to 180. That's 15. I know, but a zero up to 15. So my, my feeling is, is that the area right here was positive 90. And then on the way back it was negative 90. So this, yeah. Right. Then my displacement would be zero because it would be like as if I never left, which would be kind of deceiving. So if you see me at time zero, I'm sitting there at Malibu, and if you see me at time 15, I'm sitting back at Malibu. Right? But in the meantime, I went 90 miles north and back 90 miles south."
Redirect,3754,"Zero. Zero, okay. Because remember, that's displacement me and should have 180 would mean up, like if I rode 90 miles south and 90 miles more south. Right? But I didn't, I went 90 miles north and 90 miles south. That's what the negative means. South. Good. Otherwise everything looks good."
Evaluation,3781,Yeah.
Evaluation,3793,"It. Right? Agreed. Because it's, it's different. Yeah. So use area instead. Same. So I"
Redirect,3807,What are you guys doing?
Redirect,3810,You see it? What are you doing? So much? Work. For what?
Redirect,3833,"Right. Oh, I see. Yeah. But you know what? I think you did the same thing. So, right. Okay. So"
Redirect,3840,"Man, since I left, it's been nothing. But what is this? <laugh>. You guys have a calculator? Come on, you guys just make him do it."
Redirect,3852,"Us. You guys are killing me. You're doing everything right except calculations. Okay, this, okay, hold on. Remember this was 90, right?"
Redirect,3867,This is zero.
Redirect,3870,Not you never quits. Never quits. This one right here is negative six. Remember?
Redirect,3877,"And then this one right here was like negative 24. Which one are we doing? Oh, but I actually want eight to 15. If we wanna use anti derivatives, we have to use the equation for this piece. See, you're now using the equation for this piece. For this piece. Same as the same mistake you made before. So what's the equation for this piece? It's constant. It's constantly what?"
Redirect,3905,"So do this anti derivative negative to 15, 12."
Redirect,3910,Negative 12. Sorry.
Redirect,3913,12 dt. Right? And what's the anti derivative? Negative 12.
Redirect,3916,"12 T. Negative 12 T. And then we're gonna do that plug in 15 there. And Darren, now don't use a calculator cuz that you could actually do without a calculator. That's all you gotta do. All right. Does that make sense? You see it also, this one, all this mess was supposed to be negative six because it was that area. It was seven to eight. So we got the right equation. But <laugh>, that didn't turn out. You were off by only eight. That was pretty good. And it was supposed to be negative six, right? Because it was supposed to match up that area. Does that make sense? Yeah. All right. Here, I don't know who this is. Wait, what happened here?"
Evaluation,3959,"Oh, that's right."
Evaluation,3963,Where are we at? That's where you are?
Evaluation,3965,"Okay. Okay. Are you stuck or, um, you have all the information you need. Did you get, oh, you guys are really going for it? Yeah. Did you get 'em? One 16? Sounds right. It's not, I don't know. You know what? We can do us plug in five and see if we get 90. Is that what you did?"
Evaluation,3996,And I get a 500.
Probe,4013,Right. What did you do? How did you get 160?
Probe,4031,Probably right?
Probe,4039,I don't know. It's too hard for me.
Probe,4045,"It's hard. I didn't say. Okay. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Uhhuh. <affirmative>. Okay. And you solve for c that and you solve for c and we solve for c. So this is"
Probe,4061,Just kidding. 2 42.
Probe,4065,"Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's call it five. Square is twenty five two negative two 50. Oh yeah. Yeah, it comes out to 90. Good. Sorry. I'm sorry. <laugh>. Skying over here. Good."
Redirect,4084,"You can always put miles. Okay, hold on. You gotta finish now. So this is seven, eight and this is the anti derivative. So now you gotta go eight and seven and subtract. Okay. Right? Mm-hmm."
Extend student thinking,4122,"Yeah, you're right. But here, the only thing is you got the hard part is finding the C plus Cs. Remember how we did that before? When we and the piece wise and we have to solve for the pluses by using like the, the, we do have a lot of points on the, we have every point on the position function. So it's kind of easy to solve C cuz you can just use any point you want cuz you have that whole table full of, of values you can use for each piece. Does that make sense? But it's annoying though. I didn't, I guess I didn't, I mean you all are doing great. I didn't think we're even gonna get this far, but I have a follow up. That might be what is he doing? Good. Hey, that's all that matters. As long as there's someone in the groove that will do the work, you enjoy it. Well the first one's easy. This one's easy, by the way, this is zero plus C, but this is during the time when I'm in Santa Barbara. So this one is obviously No 84. 80"
Evaluation,4177,"Something. Not Santa Barbara. Dude, you guys are crushing you. Great job. It's like a magic trick. <laugh>."
Evaluation,4212,"Okay. Here. No, I'm just kidding. Go sit down and take a break. You're brilliant. Here. Take this anyway. Just take it for later but later. By later. I mean maybe tomorrow. Don't, you don't have to, you don't even have to do it. I, I'm just, I'm amazed how far y'all have gone. Um, there's more no drawn to scale. Okay. What does it say in total? That's the last problem. So wait, you're on one 18. Okay. Pretty much. This is a short"
Evaluation,4268,"Good job Julia. Good job Oliver. Brilliant, brilliant Mr."
Extend student thinking,4286,"Yeah, you are. That's brilliant. Uh, we have to find the slope. Okay, that's the point. That's a good point. Uh, um, no, when it's at seven it's still zero actually. And then here it's negative 12. Oh, okay. So are you gonna use that to find the slope then?"
