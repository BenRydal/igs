joke,103,"I dunno what kind of justice you're talking about, but I don't know. I can't help you. They're not gonna doing me any justice. Keep on, keep on tracking my heart rate. All right, let's go. Let's get up. Ready, set, go."
authenticity,135,"Said normal. Do it. Yeah, do what you want. Of course. Grab your things. You're good."
authenticity,139,"Normal. Enjoy your life. Give it real. Do you? Whoa,"
connection,151,"Sorry dude. Oh, that was a good thing. Wait, let me take a picture of this real quick with all this media. Oh, actually I could just get it on film. No, I'm playing"
encouragement ,299,"Yeah, go ahead. You can just leave it right here. I'll get it to All good. Good, good, good, good, good guys, I really wanted to see you guys interact. This is why I'm really excited to watch it. All right, thank you."
joke,410,"Okay. I see what you mean. Good. That's good. Yeah. Want to get my thing? I'm waiting for my tool to come in. No, don't they do like a don't they have like a thing that will tell 'em how much ghost activity there is paranormal activity. So I need one of those."
connection,468,"That like, sounds like a good Halloween costume. Like"
connection,474,Oh yeah. Do you watch that show? Is that a rough A
connection ,476,Show. It's a good
connection,483,Center. Really? They did Rats. Not
connection,487,Say that Ghost are real. So what do the other people do? They just admit that they're just like joking places.
connection,496,"Oh, they haven't actually been,"
connection,500,"Is that a joke? That sounds like a fun joke. Like that's a funny show. Like, you know, it's funny. Yeah. Cause every time you would go try to find ghosts there wouldn't be there."
connection,511,That's funny. I actually like it.
Context- math sensemaking,644,Right? Yeah. Ucsb. Yeah. How does
Context- math sensemaking,648,"Well, so, okay,"
Context- math sensemaking,650,That's Santa. Yeah. The school is like north of the city.
Context- math sensemaking,654,"It, y'all didn't apply there or why?"
Context- math sensemaking,656,Did. You did but you never went there. It's really nice.
Context- math sensemaking,660,"Well you could go visit him. You did. Right. And it's farther, it's farther north of um, it's really nice. My sister went there. I mean, I don't"
Context- math sensemaking,669,<laugh>. But you got there. Did you like it?
Context- math sensemaking,674,"Day, so Yeah. Depressing. It's a little gloomy there. They have a lot of fog, but it's really nice. Most of the time. It's really amazing. My sister went there. It's really fun, but so yeah. So you get it right? It's north, right? It's north of, um, it's further north to Santa. So like, you know, I showed you the map right here. And so like Santa Barbara's right here. And then UCSB is like right here."
Context- math sensemaking,695,"Well, what'd you get?"
Context- math sensemaking,699,"Said Sure, I know you're right. And she said she believed in me and we got that on camera and I was super happy. But, but there's, but I'd rather, we use some math. So how do we know how far I went? Because basically, right, this is my velocity, right? And time five is right here. Right? Which you already said. Cuz this is when I stopped. So, um, what happens here? Do you know? Did you read the story?"
Context- math sensemaking,718,"Just, why?"
Context- math sensemaking,722,"It doesn't say it's just, well,"
Context- math sensemaking,728,"Apartment, something like that. I lent the bike to my friend in, in U C S B. Yeah. So what I'm thinking is like, I stayed there for a little while. Like maybe I talked to him or something, right? Maybe we had some lunch or something like that. You get me what you mean? Point is like, I, I'm, I'm assuming that this would be when I got to Santa Barbara. So how, how far did I go? Like this is the velocity graph. Like what can you do? What mask can we do"
connection,810,"Oh, you no hug right now. Nice, nice hug. Are you guys are really know how to celebrate love <laugh>? Just throwing out suggestions. I'm not saying you have to. Nice."
connection,871,"Stop laughing at me. Is it right? I know I could. Oh, you want me to show your awesome work? All I mean, you're doing it. Perfect. So is it right? Yes. How do you know?"
connection,891,"You right, you're"
connection ,894,center. Really? They did Rats. Not
connection ,896,"Out. No, <laugh>. Just, I'm just"
connection,902,"I'm just,"
connection,905,"I feel like you knew that you were right and you should have known that you were right. That's good. I'm just checking. Okay. All right. Alright. Alright. You. Oh gosh, this is really, this is falling apart."
connection,916,"Having too much fun. Huh? For which one? Let me see. Three to five. Yeah, it's right. Sorry, it took me a while. Why is it right?"
Context- math sensemaking,1470,"Seven's a good answer I think. Cuz I went forward and then I stayed there for a little while. Like, let's say that I didn't just like grab my bike and run. I like talked to my friend or maybe we had a sandwich or something. Right? And then I, and then I went back here. And so by the time I get to eight, I'm not turning back. I'm already been going back. Oh. Does that make sense? All right. Good though. Good stuff. I agree with anything. Yeah. Good. Uhhuh. Good. Nick? 1 0 5. Brilliant. Good. That's great. That looks great."
encouragement ,1514,It really does. It's beautiful
encouragement ,1657,"No, it's great. I'm loving you. You, you all are so great. Put that on record. You kind of got that, you knew it already, right? Good. Brilliant. You don't need tranent,"
praise,1713,"Like 40 minutes. Oh my god. You, you're right. Okay. 40. Yeah, you're right. This is 40. Okay. Yeah. So it's my fault. You can't do that. Promise. This my phone. I just, you know what? I just added that in the other day and I messed up. Thank you. Thanks for catching my mistake. You're a genius. Um, I gotta tell everybody that one. All right. It's the same equation. Good job. Thank you for your help. Okay. I messed up on one problem. One number. You guys on, I messed up on this one. This is supposed to be 40 as you probably would know if you looked at it, but I'll catch you before you try it. Negative 28. I don't think it was ever negative 28. What's negative 28. What's 1 0 6 a only trans logic. Oh, how'd you get? 28?"
joke,1778,"It's 30 on camera. Got em. You it, perfect. You did the math perfectly. <laugh>, that's, you gotta change both <laugh>. Okay, anyway. 40 for that one. I, I, I messed up too. So don't, don't don't, don't sweat it."
joke,1797,"Oh yeah, I messed up on that one. 1 0 7. This supposed to be 40, right?"
joke,1802,"Because that's my position, right? So I started at zero and after two hours, like we go back to the graph, right? I messed up because it, it, it, it after. Oh, I just messed up everything. Help me. Any <laugh> guess right there. No, it's not this one. I know, I know, I know, I know. I'm trying to get this back too at the same time. Okay, so now I have um, uh, yeah, 0, 0, 0, right? Because I started in Malibu. Yeah. And then two is supposed to be 40. You know that cuz it was two hours of 20 miles an hour. So this is supposed to be"
joke,2034,"It's done. Or what? You're like farthest ahead. I knew you had it in you. Ah, all <laugh>. And when the cameras come"
joke,2111,"<laugh>. No, no, no. Yeah, yeah. All right. Right. Yes. And then there crucial because now I'm back cuz I went 90 and I came back 90. Okay. Interesting."
encouragement,2500,"But you're doing perfect. Great job. That's a lot of people are gonna get stuck on that or I hope they're not, but they might for sure. Yep."
Context- math sensemaking,2597,"<laugh>. No, don't tell me you're still using this equation. Yes. No, don't remember. That's not the equation. Only with that little piece. <laugh>. Okay. Same. You're just supposed to know that that's that. That's just that area. Yeah."
Context- math sensemaking,2618,"It's 90. Okay. Oh, I don't know. I don't know that. That's"
Context- math sensemaking,2627,"Okay, but what is it on 15?"
Context- math sensemaking,2632,You go back. Yeah. The area. Yeah.
Context- math sensemaking,2645,It's really funny. Times
Context- math sensemaking,2656,"It's 84. But I think this is only six, right? Because it's the half. Yeah. So in 84,"
encouragement,2753,"Did anti derivative. Yeah, you did velocity. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that actually is a change of velocity minus 12 miles per hour cuz it was zero miles. But we want the change of position. We wanna do the anti deriv. You forgot to do anti derivative. So you got the right equation. 12 x plus 84. Now you still gotta go. Dude, y'all awesome beasts. Yo, this is so good every day. No, I don't even care. Good job. You're amazing. Amazing. I'm so amazed. I'm not amazed. I'm just impressed."
praise,3006,"It's good. Your board's gonna be filled up with brilliance. It's big numbers, but you're doing it right."
connection,3302,"I need to start every time. Yeah, I should have some. That'd be cool, huh? We should just set up like a little coffee stand."
connection,3311,"Today. That would be dope. Oh, you're right. Huh? What am I thinking? Ah, man, that's good. That's good. Thinging though. Yeah. All right."
connection,3321,"Lemonade. Oh, like the, okay. Cheaper. Okay. You're gonna be the barista. Just like do"
joke,3840,"Man, since I left, it's been nothing. But what is this? <laugh>. You guys have a calculator? Come on, you guys just make him do it."
joke,3852,"Us. You guys are killing me. You're doing everything right except calculations. Okay, this, okay, hold on. Remember this was 90, right?"
encouragement,4177,"Something. Not Santa Barbara. Dude, you guys are crushing you. Great job. It's like a magic trick. <laugh>."
encouragement,4212,"Okay. Here. No, I'm just kidding. Go sit down and take a break. You're brilliant. Here. Take this anyway. Just take it for later but later. By later. I mean maybe tomorrow. Don't, you don't have to, you don't even have to do it. I, I'm just, I'm amazed how far y'all have gone. Um, there's more no drawn to scale. Okay. What does it say in total? That's the last problem. So wait, you're on one 18. Okay. Pretty much. This is a short"
yoda,4303,"One. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect. Yeah. Do that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. That's right. To find the slope. Yeah. Great. <laugh>, you finally got to use the thing and the thing you wait. You just made this and just left it here."
yoda,4328,Can I have it? Do you want it?
yoda,4332,Put it on camera. Look at this Yoda. We
yoda,4336,For real.
yoda,4339,Dude. Look at this. Yoda. They made Uhhuh
yoda,4344,You just left it there like it was nothing. It's Yoda. Yo.
yoda,4349,"Yeah, it's just, I don't know where to put it. But you shouldn't just cast it aside, right? I mean, come on. That's dope."
yoda,4364,"Yeah. Yeah. I have put it right here next to mine. He has a cane and everything. Brilliance. Brilliance. Okay, here's a, here's a thing. Follow up. Follow up. I call it."
praise,4389,"Got ours. It's okay. Let it rest. Let it rest. This is a lot. If you want, you can do the next thing instead. If you want, um, yeah, you're right. But after that you gotta do the thing where you get the plus C and you have the sulfur. All the Cs. Remember? That's kind of annoying. Do you want to do it? I think you guys knew your break. Deserve a break? Yeah,"
praise,4432,"Getting a break. You are just, this is for later. We still have 20 minutes. I don't know what to do. You guys went faster. We worked a little faster today. I'm not gonna lie. You did good. This is embarrassing. Right across the hallway. Just so you gotta have a key. Let me see. Yeah, I have one here. Go. Can I light you in? Yeah."
encouragement,4627,"Well, I mean, I made the problem so close right here. Look, look, look, look, look, look right here. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's like a, it's a typo. No, come here. Look. Come here. It's a, it's a small, it's a small as mistake possible. Look what happened right here. It's, tell me what happened right here. 84 and 2 88. Right? Uhhuh. That's not 2 64. What's 88 minus 2 0 4, right. 2 0 4. So change it and then you're right. That's amazing. I'm so impressed. Um, okay, so that means can I, can I, can I write on your board? Yes. So that means that this is linear with the SL of 20 Uhhuh till I get to four. So yeah. Tell you that's that constant increase. Yes. And then it's Quadratic. So that means it's like a little parabola here, like right, like that uhhuh and then it plans out while I'm there and then it's quadratic again. So it's like a little again, but then it's linear again. Uhhuh. There you goda. Nice. That's my whole journey, right? It's all you. Good job. Brilliant typo."
encouragement,4733,You got it. Brilliant.
praise,4771,"Yeah, yeah. No. Um, okay. That's the velocity. You're just copying it and then you're gonna do the anti derivative if you want position. Right? And you got us off for the Cs. That's the part that's kind of annoying. But most of the Cs are easy. Actually only two of 'em are kind of tricky. Okay. I um, I have a follow up that you can do. But I mean you all have done a lot. Our problem was a lot. Appreciate you for sticking with me. Um, but if you want to do more, um, if you don't wanna do that last problem where you have to solve or sea, that's pretty not that fun. It's nice to get right, but it's also nice to skip. Um, you can go, you know, go take a little break and if you wanna try this last one, maybe the, try the front page of it."
praise,4917,"Great job. That was fun. I had fun. Um, I hope you enjoyed that. Um, I would say, uh, as much as I hate to admit it, um, well, no, you know what? Screw that. That was pretty normal. I would say that like, um, there was a little bit more, And um, cognitive activity, which means your brains are working a little harder today. But that was pretty normal I thought. I don't know how you felt. Um, uh, but we got done a little faster than I thought we were, and y'all really, um, Um, we're very impressive. Um, as always, I'm always really impressed. Um, so great job. Um, that was fun. Um, someone said that we should have set up a coffee bar in the back that we should always have a coffee bar in the back. But Um, and then they said like, especially today, like today was our chance to have like a cool coffee bar."
joke,4970,"so maybe next year when they come they can bring coffee. I don't know. Anyways, um, <laugh>, just kidding. I'm joking. Um, uh, but anyways, um, maybe I'll bring it or what, whatever. I dunno how much it costs. So maybe you could chip in anyway. Um, uh, here's the graph. Here's the, so this is kind of weird. Um, what could I do? Well, nevermind. So here's position. Here's P prime, which is graphed because the position is velocity, right? So here's the graph of position. I'm sorry, here's the graph of the derivative position. Here's our velocity graph, the one we started with, okay? Um, if I increase, so what I did was I made it go from zero to a."
encouragement,5402,"Good job, Emily. You guys got it. You got it. Good. Good job"
connection,5432,"Okay. Okay. There's oh, you mean for the refreshers? I'm thinking coffee. Oh, what Refreshers is easier. It's easier. Oh yeah. Alright. Alright. The refresher bar. All right. Good idea. Good job. Good job, y'all. That was great. That was fun. Appreciate y'all."
