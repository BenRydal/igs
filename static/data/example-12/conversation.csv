1445456663,Ansley,last week when we were driving back

1445456723,Lily,yea (inaudible) the next group run through traffic
1445456720,Jarod,I think THE biggest cultural difference I've found between the north and the south is the way you cross a street
1445456723,Ansley,is what?
1445456726,Jarod,* is the way you cross the street
1445456729,Hadley,* you mean that in the south they actually use intersections and in the north and in like
1445456732,Jarod,it's just a free for all
1445456735,Ansley,I've gotten more emails in this last hour than like the last week
1445456738,Hadley,that is SO true like in new york it's like you just go

1445457053,Ansley,it's interesting
1445457056,Monique,it's not super relevant to our tour but it is very interesting

1445457062,Monique,* oh yeah
1445457065,Ansley,that's the only reason I know what it is

1445457077,Monique,you would like it
1445457080,Ansley,I bet

1445457086,Ansley,* oh cool..interesting
1445457089,Ansley,ok we're going up.. up here right now
1445457092,Ansley,how far are we going on capital?

1445457083,Hadley,aww dang
1445457086,Ansley,yea that'd be a bummer..maybe not
1445457089,Monique,this is where we are.. and here is where we are right now
1445457092,Ansley,right
1445457095,Monique,here between here and union I think that's union like I think that this is our ally see that it's blocked with the fence right now
1445457098,Hadley,we're gonna cross so
1445457101,Monique,yea we should just go I
1445457104,Ansley,we might as well look and maybe not take the livetrekker with us..just in case cuz we don't want it to double back three times
1445457107,Monique,* yea that's a good idea yea
1445457110,Hadley,well let's cross we need a
1445457113,Monique,we can get jake's opinion to..ok so we were going to go through this ally we are pretty sure that the ally is that thing with the fence in front of it like to get to

1445457149,Ansley,it could be a little further up
1445457152,Jarod,I think it might be a little further up
1445457155,Monique,ok we can walk there.. and if we can delete parts of the livetrekker thing to so it's not a big to
1445457158,Ansley,* yea let's go across the street and give it a shot

1445457185,Hadley,* right (laughing)
1445457188,Ansley,well we could just

1445457281,Jarod,please use front door
1445457284,Hadley,oh
1445457260,Ansley,it smells like poop
1445457263,Monique,uh it smells amazing I just want some fried chicken so bad right now..some fried pickles
1445457266,Monique,* I'm so hungry
1445457269,Jarod,i could definitely I could go for this..stop the tour here
1445457272,Ansley,yea this is where it was.. if the map is accurate
1445457275,Monique,hey wait we can take a picture of this sign with no public restrooms
1445457278,Jarod,here
1445457281,Monique,that's kind of funny actually
1445457284,Ansley,(laughing) that is funny
1445457287,Hadley,what is it?
1445457290,Monique,they've got a sign about no public restrooms
1445457293,Monique,wow it smells so good
1445457296,Hadley,so it's this this is the restaurant
1445457299,Monique,yea
1445457302,Ansley,yea this is where it was cuz it was right on the other side of the ally
1445457305,Jarod,I mean I think so yea
1445457308,Monique,yea
1445457311,Ansley,that's what it looks like
1445457314,Jarod,see if anything's the same
1445457317,Ansley,hmm it's so funny that still exists!
1445457320,Hadley,was it 221..i guess the address might have changed
1445457323,Jarod,I mean it makes sense that it would still be a restaurant
1445457326,Ansley,yea it was 221
1445457329,Hadley,they said what? it says it's still a restaurant
1445457332,Lily,what still exists?
1445457335,Monique,so umm jake one of his oral histories was about a sit in at a restaurant that was right at this location and it was different name different owners
1445457338,Ansley,* it was 221 so this is you can take a picture of the number yea
1445457341,Jarod,* what?.. it makes sense that it would still be a restaurant so they would try and use the space in the same way
1445457344,Lily,* oh
1445457320,Monique,but it's like still a restaurant in the same building which is kind of cool
1445457323,Lily,right funny
1445457326,Ansley,cross keys restaurant 221
1445457329,Hadley,yep
1445457332,Monique,I feel like we should zoom in a little more cuz I think like the no public restroom sign is kind of.. approppo
1445457335,Hadley,oh
1445457338,Ansley,plus getting the number in it would be good cuz the number's on the back
1445457341,Monique,those poeple inside are like what are guys doing taking pictures of our restaurant
1445457344,Ansley,(laughing) and wearing cameras
1445457347,Hadley,you have no idea!
1445457350,Jarod,we'll give them a history did you know that this restaurant used to be

1445457368,Ansley,yep we're going back down to church street again
1445457371,Ansley,and then it looks like harvey's was on the corner.. no across the street
1445457374,Monique,* that's a cute dress
1445457377,Ansley,it was across the street
1445457380,Monique,so it's not now a subway is what you're saying
1445457383,Ansley,it is now subway yea

1445457392,Monique,that's good..way to go Nashville
1445457395,Jarod,(laughing)
1445457380,Ansley,but it looks like the kind of building that would have been a department store
1445457383,Monique,yea..maybe we should maybe we should photograph this one from this far away so you can see  you know that the.. has now been subdivided
1445457386,Jarod,* yea I know what you mean
1445457389,Ansley,* here

1445457398,Hadley,yea I think you guys have a better view or like mental image
1445457401,Ansley,I think that's where it was..that looks right from here
1445457404,Monique,ok so then we would talk about it how it's like
1445457407,Ansley,cuz this is 6th yep so it would have been and we just came from this direction so that would have been harvey's right there
1445457410,Monique,* yea
1445457413,Hadley,hmhm
1445457416,Monique,yea cuz then you can see it was one building and it used to be all one thing and now it's been subdivided into different stores
1445457419,Ansley,* this is weird
1445457422,Hadley,* hmhm multiple
1445457425,Monique,yea

1445457452,Monique,yea
1445457455,Hadley,this was a site

1445457446,Hadley,it what?
1445457449,Monique,it looks like they turned it into departments

1445457542,Ansley,ok
1445457545,Hadley,it's crazy like.. that those like the sit ins and stuff were there and now it's just like
1445457548,Ansley,right!
1445457551,Jarod,taco shops and spas and
1445457554,Hadley,* just tacos and there's no history and you would never know
1445457557,Jarod,you'd never know
1445457560,Hadley,like the same with the pancake pantry like you go in there and it's like an old cool like
1445457563,Ansley,and it's not even like castranot where there's the name of the building on it
1445457566,Monique,* woah it smells amazing right now!
1445457569,Ansley,* woah geez
1445457572,Hadley,* huh
1445457560,Ansley,they're going to watch these go pros later and be like man those kids were really hungry today (laughing)
1445457563,Monique,I have some snacks
1445457566,Ansley,we've talked about food like the entire walk
1445457569,Hadley,the whole trip
1445457572,Jarod,smells great
1445457575,Hadley,it smells amazing
1445457578,Ansley,is this where pucketts is now?
1445457581,Monique,uh I guess?
1445457584,Hadley,wasn't one like on this corner?
1445457587,Ansley,* yea this was this was cain sloan
1445457590,Monique,* yea this is cain sloan
1445457593,Hadley,ohh
1445457596,Monique,and I think this would be like the main entrance for the department store.. probably
1445457599,Ansley,* yea
1445457602,Jarod,this would be what?
1445457605,Monique,so this was the site of a department store once upon a time called cain sloan which experienced sit ins and I would imagine that would be the main entrance
1445457608,Jarod,* yea
1445457611,Ansley,does it have an uh
1445457614,Hadley,address?
1445457617,Ansley,that's what I was looking
1445457620,Monique,also that's a beautiful church
1445457623,Monique,I'll look on the other side of the building though
1445457626,Ansley,no it doesn't.. not on church street but that looks like 510 so it would make sense if this was 500
1445457620,Hadley,wait where?
1445457623,Ansley,right here is what we're looking at
1445457626,Hadley,doesn't that say two oh three
1445457629,Ansley,um on this on the other around the corner yea do you want to go around the corner and look
1445457632,Hadley,yea..wait we lost a member
1445457635,Ansley,I was say where did jake go?
1445457638,Monique,so I was looking on the other side of the building see if there's something cool to photograph and there isn't but there is an interesting quote on that church sign
1445457641,Ansley,(laughing) I like it
1445457644,Hadley,* I think we should take the picture from this angle
1445457647,Monique,* seems to resonate a little bit
1445457650,Ansley,yea
1445457653,Hadley,cuz this is cool like this
1445457656,Monique,* maybe from across the street you'd get a better view of it
1445457659,Hadley,yea yea that's what I mean like from the side
1445457662,Ansley,ok
1445457665,Monique,maybe from like right there
1445457668,Ansley,oh this is where the lights are I know where I am now I literally know this street is the place where the lights are but it's fine
1445457680,Monique,so Hallie I think if you just go to that corner across there and take a picture
1445457683,Ansley,there's not.. creeping yea no there's not like um an address listed on the window or anyting
1445457686,Monique,* yea
1445457689,Monique,we should hide get a picture
1445457692,Ansley,we should oh picture

1445457698,Ansley,yea pucketts is supposed to be really good but I've never been

1445457905,Jarod,you can

1445457911,Monique,* this is pretty
1445457914,Jarod,* right right
1445457917,Hadley,so you can go in but they won't serve you
1445457920,Ansley,seventeen nineteen..I never thought about street numbers being so useful
1445457923,Monique,very useful
1445457926,Ansley,cuz frankly I never really use them
1445457929,Monique,there's another sign guys
1445457932,Ansley,hey! two twenty three that was the number
1445457935,Monique,* someone already did this

1445457944,Jarod,so wait we're not walking through the arcade right?
1445457947,Monique,no
1445457950,Ansley,no
1445457953,Hadley,* no we decided not to do it
1445457956,Ansley,although I didn't know it was a thing that's kind of interesting
1445457959,Monique,* the arcade's super cool but it's not super relevant here ok
1445457962,Jarod,it looks fun
1445457965,Hadley,it is cool
1445457968,Ansley,it looks fun
1445457971,Hadley,we can walk through it because it's more interesting than walking down union
1445457974,Jarod,it looks fun
1445457977,Ansley,two twenty three!
1445457980,Jarod,oh that looks so fun
1445457920,Hadley,woah this is such a cool picture actually
1445457923,Jarod,* oh that looks so fun
1445457926,Ansley,and then this would be a good shot of the walgreens also
1445457929,Monique,* yea
1445457932,Jarod,* yea we should get a shot we shoudl get a shot of the walgreens
1445457935,Ansley,* yea which is relevant.. cuz that's where it was and then mcclellan was another one we talked about which is a little further down.. it's more like two thirty three
1445457938,Monique,* yea
1445457941,Hadley,what does this say?
1445457944,Monique,alright so after this we're gonna go either through the arcade or on union street.. what time do we need to be finished with things
1445457947,Lily,um I mean we need to be back at the (inaudible) at three forty five
1445457950,Hadley,we've been doing this for twenty five minutes
1445457953,Ansley,* we've got time
1445457956,Jarod,we're we're good
1445457959,Ansley,* we've got time
1445457962,Monique,yea are we good?
1445457965,Jarod,we we over estimated how far of a walk this is
1445457968,Ansley,right..cuz even stopping and taking pictures just isn't that long
1445457971,Jarod,no we've been (inaudible)
1445457974,Monique,* yea
1445457977,Ansley,so..do we
1445457980,Monique,* alright do we want to go through the arcade or do we want to go up another half block and take a right on union
1445457983,Ansley,and do we want to find mcclellans store
1445457986,Monique,well if we go up toward union we'll find it as well
1445457989,Ansley,right
1445457980,Hadley,but I think the arcade's
1445457983,Monique,* the arcade's kind of interesting but
1445457986,Jarod,* if we have a landmark up there then we probably should go up there
1445457989,Ansley,yea we might as well just go to union
1445457992,Monique,yea the arcade's cool but.. not super relevant
1445457995,Ansley,* it is cool I've never even
1445457998,Jarod,I've never like is this a common thing
1445458001,Hadley,* it's it's uh all art galleries upstairs and then inside the arcade are like little businesses so it's worth going in
1445458004,Jarod,* ok
1445458007,Monique,it's two thirty three is that we're looking for?
1445458010,Ansley,yep that was easy
1445458013,Jarod,I gotta find some friends who like art
1445458016,Hadley,just turn twenty one every first saturday

1445458025,Ansley,yep
1445458028,Hadley,oh so we could go through the arcade yea
1445458031,Ansley,yea in theory
1445458034,Monique,why don't we go ahead and cross through the arcade and then we'll get a better view of the building
1445458037,Hadley,yes
1445458040,Ansley,ok
1445458043,Ansley,is it the same on both sides (laughing)
1445458046,Hadley,oh.. it's not
1445458049,Monique,oh wait you guys we should get a picture from this side so then you can get the walgreens in the background to
1445458052,Hadley,it's a different
1445458055,Ansley,yea it's different this actually talks about mcclellans woolworths perfect that's what we needed

1445458061,Hadley,yea I did
1445458040,Ansley,so it's woolworths and mcclellans and we got pictures of both solid let's roll

1445458064,Jarod,yea
1445458067,Hadley,is there any specific like I guess we can just take a picture of it
1445458070,Ansley,yea that works for me

1445458076,Jarod,* let's get a picture of the sign..also never been to frothy monkey (laughing)
1445458079,Monique,well just the style it was drawn in was not the really modern advertising style and this used to be a lunch counter so maybe

1445458289,Jarod,andrew jacksons law office
1445458292,Hadley,yea exactly interesting for our personal knowledge

1445458298,Hadley,it's like what?
1445458301,Ansley,it's like the department store we saw
1445458304,Hadley,oh yea exactly
1445458307,Ansley,like it's fascinating but not relevant to this
1445458310,Hadley,it's another historic placard up on this corner
1445458313,Ansley,oo good times
1445458316,Hadley,it's actually cool having done the history in like whatever preparing for this and then we see the placards and we're like oh we already knew that like you know what I mean like usually the purpose of those is to educate people but we had done like it's cool that we had done the like we went to those places specifically for that purpose and then there's a memorial placard there
1445458319,Ansley,* right.. right yea.. it definitely is yea.. right
1445458322,Jarod,* (laughing)
1445458325,Ansley,the seeing eye was that relevant to us? I don't think so
1445458328,Hadley,* what the heck
1445458331,Jarod,maybe
1445458334,Monique,what is that placard seeing eye.. worlds
1445458337,Ansley,hey you want to jay walk and find out
1445458340,Monique,no I can read it from here hold on..seeing eye the world famous dog eye training school nah we don't care
1445458343,Ansley,* sorry that was mean (laughing)
1445458346,Jarod,maybe not
1445458349,Hadley,oh no
1445458352,Ansley,there's a plaque for that..that's amazing!
1445458355,Monique,* courthouse!
1445458358,Ansley,yea so this is thiirdd I think
1445458361,Monique,yea
1445458364,Monique,so we should cross and then go up
1445458367,Ansley,yea cross and turn left
1445458370,Hadley,grumpy's bail bonds I love that
1445458373,Ansley,oh that's a real place and not just a billboard interesting
1445458376,Jarod,oh there it is wow
1445458379,Hadley,* the map makes these places look much further apart
1445458382,Monique,yes
1445458385,Ansley,yea it does.. it's also from the nineteen sixtys guys we can't have two (inaudible) for it
1445458388,Monique,well maybe that's like purposeful to make people think nashville's big and cool
1445458391,Hadley,* so huge
1445458394,Ansley,yea probably.. in a way
1445458397,Ansley,in case you wondered there was a dog seeing eye dog training school over there that's why there's a plaque
1445458400,Monique,seems like not a super relevant thing for a plaque you know there are much more historical things
1445458403,Ansley,* things you didn't know
1445458406,Hadley,and then there's the sit ins plaque it's like
1445458409,Ansley,I know I was really confused!
1445458400,Ansley,we were all like the seeing eye
1445458403,Monique,so we can so the courthouse is pretty
1445458406,Hadley,we wanna take it from like this from over here like this angle the picture
1445458409,Ansley,um we can get in front of
1445458412,Monique,maybe there would be prettier
1445458415,Hadley,* actually yea from over there
1445458418,Ansley,yea like at that corner that would be good
1445458421,Ansley,is it bad that I only know this area because of live on the green?
1445458424,Monique,no
1445458427,Ansley,cuz that's where it is right here
1445458430,Monique,yea
1445458433,Jarod,yea that's how I know it
1445458436,Monique,another option would be do we have a picture from that um.. event on the courthouse steps with the mayor
1445458439,Ansley,we do but it's really close up
1445458442,Hadley,you can't tell like where it is
1445458445,Monique,* we can get close up
1445458448,Monique,oh you can't tell where it is
1445458451,Hadley,no it's just people like you can't
1445458454,Ansley,but we should I mean it was on the steps so that would be good
1445458457,Monique,maybe we should go to the steps then
1445458460,Ansley,I've never seen this park in the daylight this is weird
1445458463,Ansley,just to live on the green
1445458466,Hadley,I came here for pride and that's it
1445458469,Monique,yea?
1445458472,Hadley,yea
1445458460,Monique,north carolina pride goes through durham through duke's campus
1445458463,Ansley,* I think I walked here on a date one time to but that was also night
1445458466,Monique,that sounds like a good date
1445458469,Ansley,yea we went to dinner in germantown and then went to the pedestrian bridge and back it was nice.. it was really fun.. didn't last but it was fun
1445458472,Hadley,* that's actually cool yea.. I wanna go I haven't been to the pedestrian bridge
1445458475,Monique,ok so maybe like
1445458478,Ansley,* the pedestrian bridge is awesome
1445458481,Ansley,oh guys this is perfect
1445458484,Monique,yea like this is really pretty
1445458487,Ansley,should we get on the other side so there aren't rando people standing in the middle.. or does it matter
1445458490,Monique,no I don't care about them
1445458493,Jarod,wasn't the other side where the speech was made?
1445458496,Monique,I don't know.. maybe we can take two pictures and then decide
1445458499,Ansley,yea
1445458502,Jarod,here let me see the map
1445458505,Ansley,go for it
1445458508,Jarod,* yea I mean we're we're right here yea that's true
1445458511,Monique,* yea I mean that's where I marked the x but I don't know specifically if that's
1445458514,Hadley,yea
1445458517,Monique,here's the sheriffs office and jail right here
1445458520,Hadley,but you would think that it happened like on the steps like I don't know like this is the front that's the facade of the
1445458523,Monique,* yea these are like the main steps that's just kind of like where I marked and I don't know if that x is actually where it happened
1445458526,Jarod,* yea you would think you would think
1445458529,Ansley,right
1445458520,Monique,ok so then should we go back
1445458523,Ansley,is there any sort of memorial or maker?
1445458526,Hadley,well I'm looking at these
1445458529,Ansley,yea what are these?
1445458532,Hadley,I don't know.. but there's kind of too many to.. poll tax.. fancy groceries
1445458535,Ansley,* bless you
1445458538,Monique,liquor
1445458541,Monique,thirty three
1445458544,Ansley,* sorry I stopped to read that one
1445458547,Hadley,* so maybe we can make them watch the middle of the field and that's where the picture of the mayor's thing is so it makes you feel like you're there
1445458550,Monique,* uh huh
1445458553,Monique,yea
1445458556,Ansley,(laughing) oh
1445458559,Ansley,do all of these have things on them?
1445458580,Jarod,this space feels soo much different with live on the green like it feels huge
1445458583,Lily,it feels really small and crowded?
1445458586,Jarod,i don't know like I always thought this would be bigger
1445458589,Lily,oh you mean it seems huge because of the stage
1445458592,Jarod,yea cuz of the people and the stage and like I don't know
1445458595,Lily,(inaudible)
1445458598,Jarod,yea like over there
1445458601,Monique,none of these are interesting
1445458604,Ansley,none of these are relevant?
1445458607,Monique,they're all pre like nineteen thirty
1445458610,Ansley,ahh dang
1445458613,Lily,did I ruin the picture with my
1445458616,Hadley,no they're all in it
1445458619,Jarod,uh yeah like over there
1445458622,Monique,I mean they're like interesting but they're not
1445458625,Ansley,there's got to be should we walk up to the steps and see if there's an actual plaque of some sort don't know if there is
1445458628,Monique,I doubt there is I bet there's probably been a lot of historic things.. but yea we could definitely check.. we might as well
1445458631,Ansley,* I mean we're here we might as well check..cuz I feel like you're right but.. you never know we didn't expect it at other places
1445458634,Monique,* yea
1445458637,Lily,oh they turned off those fountains that were here
1445458640,Lily,lara isn't that where fountains were or right down the stairs?
1445458635,Lily,right down the stairs you (inaudible) eightyfive degrees
1445458638,Lily,is it eighty five? (inaudible)
1445458641,Lily,no it's like eighty two (inaudible)
1445458644,Lily,anything over eighty two (inaudible)
1445458647,Ansley,man this feels a lot smaller than live on the green! I don't know how they fit this many people here
1445458650,Monique,magic
1445458653,Ansley,that's insane
1445458656,Hadley,where's the map
1445458659,Ansley,jake you have the map (laughing)
1445458662,Hadley,so are we done?
1445458665,Monique,so the map has two jails marked there's we had one more there's a jail I mean there's one up here
1445458668,Hadley,* yea like there's one on the other side of the building
1445458671,Jarod,* yea the jails the jails over there
1445458674,Monique,we can do that one I mean she didn't specify so I don't know which one is.. is correct
1445458677,Hadley,* yea yea
1445458680,Ansley,so which one was the one they were in.. is there a way to know that?
1445458683,Lily,just so you know in ten minutes we probably need to start walking back
1445458686,Ansley,ok
1445458689,Monique,yea..so let's just go around the building
1445458692,Hadley,* so let's just go around and then
1445458695,Jarod,yea let's do it.. did someone take a picture of it
1445458698,Monique,and we can even walk up close to it.. and there might be a plaque on it you know
1445458701,Ansley,* cuz if we finished here that would be fine
1445458704,Lily,you could even leave livetrekker on until you get back to the.. library or the civil rights room in case that's something you want to include
1445458707,Monique,* yea that be smart
1445458710,Ansley,* ok that's a good idea
1445458713,Hadley,* oh we should
1445458716,Lily,it's probably harder to add a line but easier to take them away
1445458719,Monique,sure
1445458722,Ansley,right
1445458725,Lily,right you can't add lines but you can take them away
1445458728,Ansley,so we might as well do that
1445458700,Hadley,BUT we could we did stop at the library so we could just say go in the library like there like if we want to include the civil rights room which we should then we could just say go in
1445458703,Monique,* yea.. for sure
1445458706,Ansley,guys this building is freaking huge.. it is huge it's so pretty
1445458709,Monique,* yes it's beautiful
1445458712,Hadley,it is actually it looks really small but when you get closer it's kinda
1445458715,Ansley,I know when you get closer it's like ginormous
1445458718,Monique,I like the fountains
1445458721,Ansley,HEY look a plaque! I'm pretty sure that says eighteen that says nineteen sixty
1445458724,Hadley,it says
1445458727,Jarod,nineteen fifty or sixty
1445458730,Ansley,yea buddy!
1445458733,Jarod,the quickest way will probably be to walk through this building
1445458736,Ansley,* HEY look religion!
1445458739,Hadley,look what?
1445458742,Monique,tightening our themes!
1445458745,Ansley,I said look religion but what..what I meant was look at bible verse (laughing) but no that was one of our themes so this is perfect..YES!
1445458748,Hadley,yea bombed
1445458751,Jarod,this is perfect
1445458754,Hadley,boom nashville thanks
1445458757,Ansley,I knew there would be a plaque.. this is really cool actually
1445458760,Ansley,I like it this memorial comemmorates the civility of those demonstrators
1445458760,Monique,they make it sound like segregation ended like right at that moment though which is not the case
1445458763,Ansley,it's not but it more or less did because one of the things in my oral history that they talked about was how unique it is was that in nashville desegregation didn't start with a courtcase it started with a community descision and the mayor talking on the steps
1445458766,Hadley,* but it is
1445458769,Monique,* uh huh
1445458772,Ansley,so it is it it like was kind of the end of segregation.. not literally but essentially
1445458775,Monique,* uh huh yea
1445458778,Monique,alright so let's walk around and see if there's still something about the sheriffs office slash jail location.. and then head back
1445458781,Hadley,I'm really impressed about like nashville's effort to like document these things
1445458784,Ansley,* yea but actually
1445458787,Hadley,because we are looking at it from a specific lens.. there are so many other things that have happened in nashville that like nashville's kind of like famous for the civil rights movement right but I don't know I wasn't expecting it to be as.. placardized as it is
1445458790,Ansley,* as complete as it is?
1445458820,Hadley,the first duty of society is justice
1445458823,Ansley,woah
1445458826,Hadley,is that a jail or what is it?
1445458829,Monique,the what?
1445458832,Hadley,it's like a line
1445458835,Ansley,oh!
1445458838,Ansley,ok so this is a municipal building
1445458841,Hadley,but wasn't it like?
1445458844,Monique,here's a place for it right there
1445458847,Hadley,perfect
1445458850,Monique,metropolitan justice center
1445458853,Ansley,so we can do kind of a loop around the whole capitol
1445458856,Hadley,and then head back?
1445458859,Ansley,yea
1445458862,Ansley,* and we could really just take
1445458865,Monique,* that's funny it looks like quincy's market in boston
1445458868,Jarod,isn't it funny that the quote on the grumpy's bail bonds thing is free at last?
1445458871,Ansley,* yea
1445458874,Monique,* yea
1445458877,Ansley,we could even just take uh it would probably be a better picture from this side of the street if we don't want to cross it
1445458880,Hadley,I don't think we should cross it it's not really necessary
1445458883,Monique,* yea
1445458886,Ansley,no I agree
1445458880,Hadley,that quote's cool
1445458883,Ansley,that is cool
1445458886,Jarod,yea
1445458889,Ansley,I don't know what that building is
1445458892,Hadley,I don't either
1445458895,Monique,the first studio society is justice

1445458910,Hadley,justice department
1445458913,Monique,well it looks like down here city market house
1445458916,Ansley,that's what that is right across the street
1445458919,Monique,* yea
1445458922,Hadley,I wonder if it's that the
1445458925,Monique,* I don't think so cuz it's behind market
1445458928,Ansley,* no it's right back here.. but that was just a parking lot in nineteen sixty
1445458931,Hadley,* yea you're right

1445458943,Lily,are all your go pros working?
1445458946,Hadley,I sense a placard
